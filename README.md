# TOMLrt
A library to make settings files for ESAPI easier to handle 
This is built upon https://github.com/dezhidki/Tommy

The core idea will be a known folder pattern and name. 

```
|-- PublishedScripts
|   |-- site.toml
|   |-- App1
|   |   |-- App1.toml
|   |   |-- Other app specific files
|   |-- App2
|   |   |-- App2.toml

```
